# CS50x

*This is CS50, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming, for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally.*

# Binary

Mathematical expression wich uses only two symbols, *0* and *1* or *false* and *true*, each symbol is a bit.

The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2.

After a bit reaches *1* in binary, an increment resets it to *0* but also causes an increment of the next bit to the left.

| Binary             | Decimal    |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| 0                  | 0          |
| 1                  | 1          |
| 10, 11             | 2, 3       |
| 100, 101, 110, 111 | 4, 5, 6, 7 |

### ASCII

Abreviated from *American Standard Code for Information Interchange*, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.

Because of technical limitations of the computer systems at the time it was invented (in 1963), has just 128 code points.

### Hexadecimal

In mathematics and computing the hexadecimal (also base-16 or simply hex) numeral system is a positional numeral system that represents number using a radix (base) of sixteen.

For example:

| Symbol | Binary  | Hex | Decimal |
| ------ | ------- | --- | ------- |
| i      | 1101001 | 69  | 105     |
| M      | 1001101 | 4D  | 77      |

### Unicode

Could be roughly described as "wide-body ASCII". The Unicode Standard, is a text encoding standard maintained by the Unicode Consortium designed to support the use of text written in all of the world's major writing systems.

### Web colors

Are colors used in displaying web pages on the World Wide Web; they can be displayed by way of three methods, for example:

| Color name | RGB triplet | % triplet | Hex triplet |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- |
| <span style="background-color:black; color:red">Red</span> | 255,0,0 | 100,0,0 | #FF0000 |
| <span style="background-color:black; color:lime">Lime</span> | 0,255,0 | 0,100,0 | #00FF00 |
| <span style="background-color:black; color:aqua">Aqua</span> | 0,255,255 | 0,100,100 | #00FFFF |
| <span style="background-color:black; color:gray">Gray</span> | 128,128,128 | 50,50,50 | #808080 |
